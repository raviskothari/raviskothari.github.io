						<p>Hi, my name is Ravi Kothari, and I am a sophomore computer science major at the University of Maryland- College Park. During my time as a computer science major and by spending some of my free time learning, I have acquired several skills that have allowed me to succeed within the program. These skills include Java, C, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Matlab.  I have developed a true passion for the computer science field, and I hope to use these skills in the future as a software developer. </p>

						<p>In addition to my work within the computer science field, I am also a volunteer EMT (Emergency Medical Technician). I started my volunteer EMT career after my junior year of high school, when I took the EMT-B course and became a New Jersey State Certified EMT. I currently volunteer at <a href="https://pfars.org">Princeton First Aid and Rescue Squad</a> in Princeton, NJ and <a href="http://bvfco11.com/">Branchville Volunteer Fire Company</a> in College Park, MD. Over the past three years, I have risen from the ranks of a junior, probitionary member to a senior, active member. I have also recently started driving the ambulance in an emergency setting. Through my experiences as an EMT, I have grown as a person and I truley understood the idea of community service. </p>

						<p>If you would like to find out more about me, please do not hesitate to contact me. </p>
