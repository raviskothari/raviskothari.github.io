								<h2>About Me<br /></h2>
								<p> Hello, my name is Ravi Kothari, and I am currently a junior at the University of Maryland- College Park. I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Computer Science, and I am expecting to graduate in May 2019. </p>

								<p> Through my coursework and spending free time learning new programming languages, I have acquired several skills that will allow me to succeed as a software developer. I am ecstatic to work for a technology-driven company and will be consistently using my internship experiences and school work. Besides my studies, I also have keen interests in biology, watching and playing sports, and serving my community as a volunteer EMT (Emergency Medical Technician). </p>

								<p> This past summer, I was a technical analyst at Pfizer Inc., where I helped the business and finance operations team with data analysis. I used tools such as SQL, Tableau, etc. in order to provide the team with analytics about their ticketing system. It was a great experience, and I enjoyed working with new technologies throughout my internship. </p>

								<p> As a New Jersey native, I am a die-hard New York Yankees fan. I love to watch basketball and football, as I am a New York Knicks and New York Giants fan. Besides professional sports, I also follow the Maryland Terrapins. The Terps have a great history in sports, especially in basketball and soccer, and watching the Terps dominate their opponents has added to my college life experience.

								<p> Another interest I have developed is serving my community as a volunteer EMT. I started my volunteer EMT career after my junior year of high school, when I took the EMT-B course and became a New Jersey State Certified EMT. I currently volunteer at <a href="https://pfars.org" target="_blank">Princeton First Aid and Rescue Squad</a> in Princeton, NJ and <a href="http://bvfco11.com/" target="_blank">Branchville Volunteer Fire Company</a> in College Park, MD. Over the past three years, I have risen from the ranks of a junior, probationary member to a senior, operational member able to make critical decisions. I have also recently started driving the ambulance in an emergency setting. </p>

								<p>I intend to pursue a career in software development and engineering, and will continuing to pursue my passion for volunteerism as a hobby. If you have questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact me. </p>

								<h2> Projects </h2>
								<p>An overview of some of the most impressive computer science projects I have programmed:</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-internet-explorer">
									<h3><a href="https://raviskothari.github.io">Personal Website</a></h3>
									<p>For this project, I developed my own personal website using HTML and CSS programming languages. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3><a href="https://github.com/raviskothari/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a></h3>
									<p>For this project, I am using Python and the PyGame library in order to create a user friendly video game. I am using several different PyGame functions to allow for the user to be able to control the game. The purpose of the game is to use your character to shoot at enemy aliens and destroy them. I will also implement a running counter that will act as a score. To see project specifics, please see the link embedded in the title.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Shell Project</h3>
									<p>For this project, I used the C programming language in order to implement a shell from scratch. The shell supported boolean operations, pipes, subshell operations, and file redirection. The first task was to make a Makefile from scratch using explicit rules. The project was implemented using a tree data structure. The shell executed commands inputted by the user, and the program would be able to run the command. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3><a href="https://github.com/raviskothari/war">War-iOS Application</a></h3>
									<p>For this project, I used the Swift programming language to implement a simple game called War. I used Xcode to build this application. The objective of the game is to have a higher card then the computer. The card is dealt randomly everytime the user pushes the "Deal" button, and the user can then see their own card as well as the computer's card. The game also keeps track of the score.To see project specifics, please see the link embedded in the title</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Calendar Application</h3>
									<p>For this project, I used the C programming language to implement several functions that support a calendar application. Some of the key aspects of this project included using linked lists in C, dynamic memory allocation, file input/output, using structs, etc. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Interest Calculator</h3>
									<p>For this project, I used the Java programming languange to implement my own interest calculator. I created this interest calculator from scratch, and ulimately made a graphical user interface (GUI) in which the user was able to enter values to caluclate simple and compound interests. </p>
