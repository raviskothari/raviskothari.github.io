								<h2>About Me<br /></h2>
								<p> Hello, my name is Ravi Kothari, and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Maryland- College Park. I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Computer Science, and I am expecting to graduate in May 2019. </p>

								<p> Through my coursework and spending free time learning new programming languages, I have acquired several skills that will allow me to succeed as a software developer. I am looking to pursue my passions in machine learning, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, biotechnology, and data analysis. However, as a sophomore, I am still exploring the different fields within the computer science field. I am ecstatic to work for a technology-driven company and will be consistently using my internship experiences and school work. Besides my studies, I also have keen interests in biology, watching and playing sports, and serving my community as a volunteer EMT (Emergency Medical Technician). </p>

								<p> As a New Jersey native, I am a die-hard New York Yankees fan. I love to watch basketball and football, as I am a New York Knicks and New York Giants fan. Besides professional sports, I also follow the Maryland Terrapins. The Terps have a great history in sports, especially in basketball and soccer, and watching the Terps dominate their opponents has added to my college life experience.

								<p> Another interest I have developed is serving my community as a volunteer EMT. I started my volunteer EMT career after my junior year of high school, when I took the EMT-B course and became a New Jersey State Certified EMT. I currently volunteer at <a href="https://pfars.org" target="_blank">Princeton First Aid and Rescue Squad</a> in Princeton, NJ and <a href="http://bvfco11.com/" target="_blank">Branchville Volunteer Fire Company</a> in College Park, MD. Over the past three years, I have risen from the ranks of a junior, probationary member to a senior, operational member able to make critical decisions. I have also recently started driving the ambulance in an emergency setting. </p>

								<p>I intend to pursue a career in software development and engineering, and will continuing to pursue my passion for volunteerism as a hobby. If you have questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact me. </p>

								<h2> Projects </h2>
								<p>An overview of some of the coolest computer science projects I have programmed:</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-internet-explorer">
									<h3><a href="https://raviskothari.github.io" target="_blank">Personal Website</a></h3>
									<p>For this project, I developed my own personal website using HTML and CSS programming languages.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Aliens Invasion Project</h3>
									<p>For this project, I used the Python programming language to implement a simple game. I utilized Pygame (collection of Python modules that manages graphics, animation, etc.) to create a ship that moves right and left, and fires bullets in response to player input.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Grade Calculator Project</h3>
									<p>For this project, I used the C programming language in order to create a program that read assignment scores and computed numeric grades and statistical information, including the mean and standard deviation. I was tasked to use arrays and C commands in order to complete this project.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Blackjack Project</h3>
									<p>For this project, I used the Java programming language to implement a game of blackjack. Using classic Vegas rules, I was able to create the game and successfully create several cases in order for the game to function as normal.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Interest Calculator</h3>
									<p>For this project, I used the Java programming languange to implement my own interest calculator. I created this interest calculator from scratch, and ulimately made a graphical user interface (GUI) in which the user was able to enter values to caluclate simple and compound interests.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Other Projects</h3>
									<p> Poker Game, Maze Project (Implemented Using a Graph), Polymorphmic Binary Search Tree, Doubly Linked List (From Scratch), And Many More! </p>
								</li>
